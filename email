Greetings, John Sparc

I am from a small online church, and I'm here to
inform you that we want you to have fun
while doing your part
to ensure that less fortunatee
people have homes
that they can call their own.  Trust
me, you'll feel much better knowing that people are happy.

I just want you to know that I really am
on your side, and, although you might not believe, I
really am trying to help.  So please, can
you take a moment to listen to me
and hear what I have to say.

I am from a small country near Charleton
which is in the country of Urgandu
near the Pacific Ocean.  My church is on main/
5th street, in the absolute worst part
of the city.  Why? We always try to save
our money for people who need it, in our charties
rather than wasting it on a habitat
for us.   For a very small donation, you too can help
the less fortunate.  One man from Alabama
gave us only $40, and got a hug
for his generosity.  Wouldn't you love
to get that? I know I would.

If you are willing to donate, or even just wish
us good luck, please don't
hesitate to reply.  God loves you, and I hope you are blessed by Him

- Reverant John Chammel
